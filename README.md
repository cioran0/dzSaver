# dzSaver

Tkinter GUI (yes I know Vips has a GUI), but it's kind of complicated and not my cup of tea. Uses VIPS (libvips) over at https://github.com/libvips/libvips to create dzi files using the vips dzsave command I always use for OSD. Can Change directory or reset directory, can keep dragging over files. Only tested on Windows so far but works fine on that. Directs you to libvips site if you don't have it installed.

Uses tkinter and must install tkinter2dnd mentioned in requirements.
